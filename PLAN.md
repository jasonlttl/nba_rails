# Plan
  1. Design Schema for stats
    There are a two main things that I want to be able to analyze:
    - Pace
    - Points per possession (scored & allowed)
      - note: figure out how all the different efficiency stats fit into this

    In addition to these things, I would also like to be able to split these stats
    up into different timeframes:
    - quarters and overtime
    - month
    - season
    - home vs away
    - rest
